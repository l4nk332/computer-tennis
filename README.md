# Computer Tennis

## Overview
*Computer Tennis* is an in-browser game that implements the [HTML Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) to recreate and add a variety of modes to the classic game [*Pong*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong).

## Gameplay

### Objective
The objective of the game is to prevent the ball from getting past your paddle fewer times than your oppenent.

### 
As you rally back and forth the velocity of the ball will increase with each collision. When you lose a rally your paddle gets smaller by a fixed percentage, and if you win the rally your paddle will increase by half of that fixed percentage (unless at original paddle size). 

### Modes
There are currently 3 unique visual modes, each with additional settings that can be adjusted regarding SFX or courts:

1. **Tennis** - A tennis-like aesthetic that has the option for tennis grunt or tennis racket sound effects. The courts available pertain to the [Grand Slam of Tennis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)) and their respective color schemes:
  * Australian Open
  * French Open
  * Wimbledon
  * US Open

2. Classic - The original look and sound of the original classic [*Pong*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong).

3. Chromatic - An experimental mode with a more modern soundscape, and a ball that changes colors on each collision.
